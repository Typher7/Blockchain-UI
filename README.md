# The "Network Error" in your Axios request usually occurs due to one of these reasons:

# CORS Issues:
If your frontend and backend are running on different origins (e.g., localhost:3000 for React and localhost:5000 for Flask), the browser blocks the request. You can fix this by adding CORS support to your Flask app:

# Python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)

# Backend Not Running:
Ensure the Flask server is running and accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

# Incorrect URL:
Double-check the URL in your Axios request to match your Flask endpoint.
